/**
 * Workspace-scoped credential store.
 *
 * Per-bundle credentials live at:
 *   {workDir}/workspaces/{wsId}/credentials/{bundle-slug}.json
 *
 * File format is plain JSON key-value — no metadata envelope:
 *   { "api_key": "sk-...", "workspace_id": "ws-..." }
 *
 * This is the tier-1 primitive for NimbleBrain's workspace-scoped credential
 * resolution. This module implements the file-level CRUD only; the tier
 * resolver layered on top is `resolveUserConfig` in the same module.
 *
 * Security posture:
 *   - Files are written with `0o600`, the `credentials/` directory is created
 *     with `0o700`, and writes are atomic (temp file + rename).
 *   - `wsId` is validated against `WORKSPACE_ID_RE` on every call because the
 *     path derived from it is a filesystem path — a caller passing `../evil`
 *     would otherwise escape the workspace tree. We don't trust the call site.
 *   - Credential values are never logged; only keys and paths appear in
 *     diagnostics.
 *
 * Class vs free functions:
 *   - `WorkspaceCredentialStore` is the preferred API — constructed once with
 *     `{ wsId, workDir }` and used through instance methods. It is owned by
 *     `WorkspaceContext` (`src/workspace/context.ts`).
 *   - The free-function exports (`getWorkspaceCredentials`,
 *     `saveWorkspaceCredential`, `clearWorkspaceCredential`,
 *     `clearAllWorkspaceCredentials`, `resolveUserConfig`) remain as thin
 *     shims so call sites can migrate incrementally. They are scheduled for
 *     removal once every site uses `WorkspaceContext.getCredentialStore()`.
