/**
 * `compose` platform source — exposes `compose__effective_context`.
 *
 * Single-call answer to "what's in the system prompt for conversation X,
 * with provenance per layer." Replaces the manual jsonl-grep workflow
 * for prod debugging.
 *
 * Two modes:
 *   - **Live (default).** Re-gathers the same inputs `runtime.chat()` uses
 *     and runs `composeSystemPromptTraced` to produce the full per-layer
 *     breakdown for the current state. Honest answer to "what would
 *     compose right now if a turn started in this conversation."
 *   - **Historical (`run_id` set).** Reads `context.assembled` and
 *     `skills.loaded` events for the given run from the conv jsonl. For
 *     each Layer 3 skill, re-reads the current on-disk body, computes its
 *     SHA-256, and compares to the recorded `contentHash`. Hash matches
 *     mean the recorded body is recoverable verbatim; mismatches mean
 *     the skill was edited since the run, and the tool surfaces a
 *     warning with the path to the most recent `_versions/` snapshot
 *     when one matches the recorded hash.
 *
 * Historical mode v1 covers Layer 3 skills only — non-L3 layers
 * (identity, prefs, overlays, apps, focused-app, app-state) aren't
 * recorded in `context.assembled` events with enough detail to
 * reconstruct, and snapshotting full bodies into events was rejected as
 * too expensive (10-100× event size). The tool's response sets
 * `mode: "historical"` and includes a `non_l3_layers_omitted` warning
 * directing the caller at live mode for the rest.

 *
 * All three response fields are kept consistent with the filtered layers:

 * filtered layer texts). Earlier versions left `text` untouched, which
 * meant a caller using `r.totalTokens` to budget context would be misled
 * by an `r.text` carrying content from layers that aren't in
 * `r.layers` — a self-inconsistent response.
 *
 * Note that for sections like `apps` where `subItems` are pared, the
 * layer's `text` field still contains the section's full original
 * formatting (we don't re-run the apps-section formatter against just
 * the filtered apps). This is honest about scope: the tool surfaces the
 * filtered subItems for fine-grained inspection while keeping section
