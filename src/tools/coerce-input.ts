/**
 * Schema-aware input coercion. Runs before `validateToolInput` at every
 * tool-call entry point.
 *
 * Why this exists: the wire format for streaming tool calls historically
 * delivered `function_call.arguments` as a JSON-encoded string (OpenAI's
 * legacy shape). Models trained against that convention sometimes
 * overgeneralize and stringify *nested* object/array values too — emitting
 * `{ manifest: "{\"name\":\"foo\"}" }` instead of `{ manifest: { name: "foo" }}`.
 *
 * The engine and `inbound-fit` already JSON-parse the *outer* `input` when
 * it arrives as a string. This helper extends the same forgiveness one
 * level deeper: schema-driven, not depth-limited. We use the schema as a
 * parsing oracle — for any property declared as `object` or `array`, if
 * the actual value is a string, attempt `JSON.parse` once and substitute
 * the parsed value. Recurse into the parsed result so deeply nested
 * misencodings unwind in one pass.
 *
 * Non-parseable strings (and strings where the schema didn't expect an
 * object/array) pass through unchanged — the validator reports them with
 * its content-aware error. Non-string values are untouched.
 *
 * Idempotent: a properly shaped input survives unchanged. Safe to call at
 * multiple boundaries without amplification.
 *
 * Why not AJV's `coerceTypes`: AJV only coerces between scalar types
 * (string ↔ number, etc.). It does not parse string-as-JSON into objects
 * or arrays. This helper fills exactly that gap.
 *
 * ## Union schemas (`anyOf` / `oneOf`)
 *
 * Pydantic v2 encodes `Optional[T]` / `T | None` as
 * `{ anyOf: [{ type: <T-shape> }, { type: "null" }] }` — the canonical
 * shape for any optional structural parameter on a FastMCP bundle. We
 * resolve such unions before coercing: `null` branches carry no
 * structural shape, so we drop them; what remains is the effective
 * sub-schema. For the dominant `T | null` case this collapses to a single
 * concrete branch and the rest of the coercer operates as if the property
 * had been declared with a plain `type` from the start.
 *
 * Unions with two or more structural branches (rare; e.g. `list | dict`, or
 * any union that also includes a `string` branch) pass through unchanged —
 * we deliberately do not guess. Coercion's premise is that a stringified
 * value is a misencoding, which only holds when the schema can't accept a
 * string; a union that accepts a string accepts the value as-is, so coercing
 * it would silently change a legitimate value's type. The validator
 * adjudicates. Disambiguation can be added additively if a real bundle ever
 * ships such a param.
 *
 * `allOf` and `$ref` are out of scope. A property declared with either
 * passes through unchanged at that level — the validator still gets to
 * speak. The bug class this helper solves (`Optional[list[...]]` /
 * `Optional[dict[...]]` on FastMCP bundles) does not require them.
