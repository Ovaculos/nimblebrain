/**
 * Process-local registry for pending OAuth authorization flows.
 *
 * Bridges `WorkspaceOAuthProvider` (initiator) and the
 * `/v1/mcp-auth/callback` route (code receiver) when the auth flow requires
 * a real browser round-trip. Keyed by the OAuth `state` parameter.
 *
 * For headless flows (Reboot Anonymous in `rbt dev`), the provider resolves
 * its own deferred directly from `redirectToAuthorization` and does not
 * register here — the registry is only used when an HTTP callback actually
 * arrives from outside the provider's control.
 *
 * State is not persisted: OAuth flows complete in seconds, and if a process
 * restart interrupts one, re-initiating is correct. Cross-process concerns
 * don't apply — NimbleBrain runs single-process. Intra-process leaks, on
 * the other hand, matter: an orphaned pending-flow entry (user closed the
 * tab, network failure, never hit the callback) would keep a promise alive
 * forever if not timed out. Every registration is bounded by a 15-minute
 * TTL — long enough for a reasonable interactive OAuth round-trip, short
 * enough that a stuck flow is reclaimed before it piles up.
