/**
 * Watcher-driven cache for the per-workspace tool list.
 *
 * Modeled on `src/bundles/conversations/src/index-cache.ts` — same shape
 * (lazy populate on first read + `fs.watch` invalidation + debounce). The
 * pattern is load-bearing: re-scanning the FS on every `aggregateToolList`
 * call is exactly the `getUserConversationStore` perf footgun this
 * refactor is meant to head off.
 *
 * Layout:
 *
 *   ToolListCache
 *     ├─ Per-workspace `Tool[]` (Map<wsId, Promise<Tool[]>>) — populated
 *     │  lazily on first ask. Each entry resolves through the
 *     │  caller-supplied `listToolsForWorkspace(wsId)`.
 *     ├─ Per-identity `NamespacedToolDescriptor[]` (Map<identityId,
 *     │  Promise<NamespacedToolDescriptor[]>>) — the union the
 *     │  orchestrator hands out.
 *     ├─ One `fs.watch` per workspace, attached on first touch and
 *     │  shared across every identity whose membership includes that
 *     │  workspace. Coalesces burst events into a debounce window
 *     │  (default 100ms — inside the spec's 50–250ms band, matching
 *     │  `index-cache`'s shape).
 *     └─ `dispose()` closes every watcher and clears every cache.
 *
 * What the watcher watches: each workspace's `workspace.json` file at
 * `<workDir>/workspaces/<wsId>/workspace.json` — the canonical
 * persistence target for `bundles[]` writes by `BundleLifecycleManager`
 * via `WorkspaceStore.update` (and the in-place `atomicWrite` calls in
 * `src/bundles/lifecycle.ts`). When that file changes (install /
 * uninstall / reorder), the per-workspace tool list might too — drop the
 * cached entry and every identity-union that included this workspace.
 *
 * The cache deliberately does NOT model "remove this identity from
 * `userIdentities`" or "remove this workspace from the workspaces set"
 * via FS events — those are membership / store-shape changes the
 * aggregator detects on its own when the identity's
 * `workspaceStore.getWorkspacesForUser(...)` answer changes. A separate
 * `invalidateIdentity(identityId)` entry point lets the orchestrator
 * push membership-change signals in explicitly (workspace removed,
 * member removed, etc.). Keeping membership outside the watcher avoids
 * polling the workspace store from the FS layer.
