/**
 * Catalog of remote MCP connectors NimbleBrain knows about. Surfaces
 * to the Settings → Connectors page so users can install + connect
 * services with one click rather than editing `workspace.json` directly.
 *
 * Distribution model:
 *
 *   1. `DEFAULT_CONNECTOR_CATALOG` (this file) ships with the platform —
 *      curated by NimbleBrain, vetted entries, sensible scope hints.
 *   2. `NB_CATALOG_PATH` env var (optional) points at a JSON file
 *      (typically a Kubernetes ConfigMap) that **fully replaces** the
 *      default. Operators with custom needs ship their own catalog
 *      without an app release. Replace, not merge — see `load-catalog.ts`
 *      for the rationale.
 *   3. Per-workspace `connectorsAllowList` filter narrows the visible
 *      set (admin reads `workspace.json` to control which services a
 *      tenant sees on their Connectors page).
 *
 * Secrets stay OUT of the catalog. `auth: "static"` entries reference
 * the credential store via `operatorSetup.clientSecretKey` — the value
 * is set by the workspace admin via the Set up modal (writes through
 * `manage_connectors.setup_operator`) or, for headless deployments,
 * `nb credential set <wsId> <key> <value>`. Never lives in the catalog
 * ConfigMap.
 *
 * Icons hosted at `https://static.nimblebrain.ai/icons/<id>.svg` —
 * existing repo. Self-host deployments behind firewalls can override
 * via the catalog's `iconUrl` field (any absolute URL works).
