 *   - `scope: "global"`   — broadcast to every connected client (e.g. shared
 *                            config, skills library, workspace-agnostic events)
 *   - `scope: "workspace"` — broadcast only to clients whose `workspaceId`
 *                             matches `data[wsIdField]`. The named field MUST
 *                             be present on the event's payload; if it's
 *                             missing we drop the event rather than fan it
 *                             out to every workspace (the alternative leaks
 *                             one workspace's signals to its neighbors).
 *
 * Events with no entry are NOT forwarded — operational events like
 * `tool.progress` / `tool.done` / `run.error` stay internal to the runtime.
 *
 * Adding a new SSE-bound event type is a one-line edit here. The
 * `Partial<Record<EngineEventType, SseRoute>>` shape makes the key a
 * compile-time check against `EngineEventType`, so a typo or a renamed
 * event surfaces as a build error rather than silently no-routing.
