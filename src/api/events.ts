 *     MODEL called, which post-Stage-2 is workspace-namespaced
 *     (`ws_<id>-<source>__<tool>`).
 *   - `tool.progress` → separate `source` + `tool`; `McpSource` emits the

 *
 * Both are normalized to the **bare** source name via `bareToolName` before
 * the `__` split. This is load-bearing: the Synapse `useDataSync` consumer
 * matches the broadcast `server` against the iframe's `data-app`, which is the
 * bare placement `serverName` (see `PlacementRegistry` — serverName and wsId
 * are stored as separate fields). A namespaced `server` never matches, so the
 * iframe would only refresh on remount (the "click off and back" symptom).
 * Stripping the prefix also restores the `nb` system-tool guard:
 * `ws_<id>-nb__x` → `nb__x` → server `nb`, which we skip (system tools don't
 * mutate app data, and broadcasting for them re-fetches every streaming chunk).
 *
 * `data.changed` remains workspace-blind (`scope: "global"`, matched on bare
 * server) — the pre-Stage-2 contract. Growing `wsId` into the payload for
 * true per-workspace scoping is tracked separately (see `SSE_ROUTES`).
