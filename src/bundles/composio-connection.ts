/**
 * Composio connected-account state for a workspace.
 *
 * NimbleBrain integrates with Composio as a remote OAuth provider for
 * toolkits (Gmail, Slack, HubSpot, …) where we do not yet hold the
 * vendor's own restricted-scope approval. Composio holds the user's
 * vendor tokens; the platform only holds an opaque `connectedAccountId`
 * pointer per workspace per connector.
 *
 * Storage layout (mirrors `oauth-tokens.ts` workspaceOAuthDir):
 *   <workDir>/workspaces/<wsId>/credentials/composio/<connectorId>/connection.json
 *
 * The file is the gating signal for a Composio-backed connector: if
 * present and `status === "ACTIVE"`, the platform may resolve its
 * remote-MCP URL with `user_id={NB_USER_ID}` and start the source. If
 * absent, the connector stays in `not_authenticated` until
 * `/v1/composio-auth/callback` writes it.
 *
 * Security posture mirrors workspace-credentials.ts: 0o700 directory,
 * 0o600 file, atomic temp+rename writes, wsId validated against
 * WORKSPACE_ID_RE before any path is built.
