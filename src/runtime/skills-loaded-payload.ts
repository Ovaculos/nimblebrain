/**
 * Build the `skills.loaded` payload from the Layer 3 selection result.
 *
 * Each entry carries:
 *   - `id` — sourcePath, or an in-memory sentinel for skills synthesized at
 *     runtime (workspace identity overrides, etc.)
 *   - `scope` — defaults to `org` when the manifest doesn't pin one
 *   - `version` — file mtime as a stable change marker, "" for in-memory
 *   - `tokens` — approximate, summed into the payload total
 *   - `contentHash` — SHA-256 hex of the body that was composed into the
 *     prompt. Lets debug tools detect mutation between when the skill loaded
 *     and when an operator inspects it (see `SkillsLoadedEntry` for full
 *     rationale).
 *   - `loadedBy` / `reason` — propagated from the selector for telemetry.
 *
 * Pure function; no FS access beyond the mtime read for `version`.
