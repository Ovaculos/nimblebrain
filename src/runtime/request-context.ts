 * rather than rejected at runtime — `requireWorkspaceId()` can't be defeated by
 * a stray `null`, because there is no null to pass.
 *
 * - `workspace` — owned by a workspace, authorized by membership. Carries the
 *   workspace's agent profiles + model overrides (loaded for the chat path;
 *   `null` for the leaner REST / MCP dispatch paths).
 * - `identity` — owned by the user (conversations, …), authorized by ownership.
 *   No workspace, so no workspace fields. See `tools/identity-sources.ts`.
