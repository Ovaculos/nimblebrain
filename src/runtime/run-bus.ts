/**
 * RunBus — server-authoritative, replayable per-conversation turn log.
 *
 * A chat turn runs to completion on the server regardless of any client
 * connection. The RunBus is the in-memory source of truth for an in-flight
 * turn: it owns the turn's cancellation handle and an ordered event log with
 * monotonic sequence numbers.
 *
 * Delivery is the runtime's job, not the bus's: {@link RunBus.publish} buffers
 * each event and returns it, and the runtime fans that return value out to live
 * SSE subscribers (`onTurnEvent`). A freshly connecting viewer first replays
 * the buffer via {@link RunBus.bufferedSince} (so a refresh reconstructs the
 * in-progress message), then tails. The bus stays a pure buffer + lifecycle —
 * one delivery path, no parallel subscriber set to keep in sync.
 *
 * Why it exists (issue #254 follow-up — conversation-tab rewrite):
 *   - The client is a *viewer*. Disconnect / refresh / conversation-switch
 *     never lose or duplicate work — they just replay-from-seq and re-tail.
 *   - The turn's lifecycle is decoupled from the originating HTTP request.
 *     Closing the tab does NOT abort generation; only an explicit
 *     {@link RunBus.cancel} (the Stop button) does.
 *
 * Scope: single-process, in-memory. Multi-replica (`platform.replicas > 1`)
 * needs a Redis-backed log + conversationId-sticky routing — deferred,
 * mirrors the `SessionRegistry` pattern.
