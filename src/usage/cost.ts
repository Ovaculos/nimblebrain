 * `inputTokens` is the GRAND TOTAL of all input-side tokens, equal to
 * `noCache + cacheRead + cacheWrite`. The Anthropic provider explicitly
 * computes it that way:
 *   total = inputTokens + cacheCreationTokens + cacheReadTokens
 * So the cost formula must subtract cache reads and cache writes from
 * `inputTokens` before applying the full input rate, otherwise cache
 * tokens get billed twice (once at full input rate, once at the cache
 * rate). The clamp to 0 guards against corrupted event data where the
 * cache subtotals exceed the recorded total.
 *
 * Pricing model — output side: reasoning tokens are a SUBSET of
 * `outputTokens` per the V3 spec (`outputTokens.total = text + reasoning`).
 * When a model has a distinct `cost.reasoning` rate, reasoning tokens are
 * billed at that rate and the remainder of `outputTokens` at `cost.output`
 * — splitting rather than adding. When the model lacks `cost.reasoning`,
 * all output tokens bill at `cost.output`, including any reasoning
 * subtotal.
