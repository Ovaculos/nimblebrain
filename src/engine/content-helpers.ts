 * Bound a tool result's text to the model-context budget.

 * Tool results are persisted in full (for the UI and the conversation
 * record), but they must be bounded before they enter MODEL context — both
 * in the live engine loop AND on history replay. Without a bound on replay,
 * a large result re-enters the prompt on every subsequent turn and dominates
 * token cost (and, with prompt caching, gets re-written into the cache each
 * time the prefix lapses). This is the single source of truth for that
 * bound: the engine and the history reconstructor both call it, so the
 * model's live view and its replayed view of a result are identical.
 *
 * Pure and deterministic — the same input always yields the same output, so
 * the replayed prompt prefix stays byte-stable and cacheable.
 *
 * - Text at or under `limit` is returned unchanged.
 * - With an inline-UI resource, the model gets a short pointer instead of the
 *   payload (the UI renders the full result), matching the existing inline-UI
 *   truncation behavior.
 * - Otherwise the text is trimmed on a line boundary up to `limit`, with an
 *   explicit, actionable marker so the model knows the result was bounded,
 *   that the full version is on the user's screen, and how to retrieve
 *   specific items (filter / narrower scope / pagination) without blindly
 *   re-calling the same tool.
 *
 * `limit` is a soft target: when trimming occurs the returned string exceeds
 * it by the marker length (~200 chars). Callers needing a hard ceiling must
 * clamp the result themselves.
