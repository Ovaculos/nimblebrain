/**
 * Per-run loop supervisor.
 *
 * Watches the (toolName, isError, content) fingerprint of every tool result
 * inside an engine run. If a single tool returns the same fingerprint N
 * times in a row, the supervisor declares that tool stuck and replaces its
 * next result with a synthetic directive instructing the model to stop
 * calling the tool and produce a final response.
 *
 * Two failure modes this catches:
 *  - Upstream returns identical 4xx errors on every call (e.g. a tool whose
 *    schema-derived args trigger a deterministic server-side rejection).
 *  - Upstream returns identical "empty success" payloads (pagination dead-ends).
 *
 * Per-tool isolation: a stuck tool doesn't trip the supervisor on unrelated
 * tools. Reset-on-different-fingerprint preserves legitimate adaptive retry
 * behaviour (a tool that fails once with error A, then once with error B,
 * then succeeds, never trips).
 *
 * The supervisor itself never aborts the run; the engine reads the verdict
 * and decides what to surface. On a trip the engine also filters the
 * tripped tool out of the model's toolset for the rest of the run, so the
 * model can't call the broken tool again regardless of how it reads the
 * synth directive.
