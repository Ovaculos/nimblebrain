/**
 * Per-run loop supervisor.
 *
 * Watches the per-call fingerprint of every tool result inside an engine
 * run. If a single tool returns the same fingerprint N times in a row,
 * the supervisor declares that tool stuck and replaces its next result
 * with a synthetic directive instructing the model to stop calling the
 * tool and produce a final response.
 *
 * Three failure modes this catches:
 *  - Upstream returns identical 4xx errors on every call (e.g. a tool
 *    whose schema-derived args trigger a deterministic server-side
 *    rejection). The model often retries with cosmetic argument tweaks
 *    and gets the same rejection each time.
 *  - Upstream returns identical "empty success" payloads to the same
 *    call (pagination dead-ends; idempotent lookups against an
 *    unchanged state).
 *  - A tool reports it made no progress (a discovery search matching
 *    nothing) while the model keeps varying the query — so input AND
 *    content differ every call, defeating the two fingerprints below.
 *
 * Fingerprint composition (three shapes of "stuck"):
 *
 *  - NON-ADVANCING: (toolName, NONADVANCING). When `result._meta` carries
 *    `NON_ADVANCING_META_KEY`, the fingerprint ignores input and content,
 *    so a tool that keeps reporting no progress trips at N regardless of how
 *    the model varied the call. Catches the flailing-discovery loop the
 *    input-aware SUCCESS path deliberately lets through.
 *
 *  - SUCCESS: (toolName, S, content, canonical(input)).
 *    A successful call advances state; "stuck" means the model invoked
 *    the same call (same name + same input) and got the same answer
 *    back, repeatedly. Distinct inputs producing structurally-uniform
 *    success output (e.g. `patch_source(edits=...)` returning
 *    `applied:true, compiled:true` for each of several edits in a row)
 *    is progress, not a loop, and must not trip.
 *
 *  - ERROR: (toolName, E, content). Input is deliberately omitted so
 *    the "model retries-with-tweaks against a deterministic rejection"
 *    failure mode still trips at N repeats — the canonical case the
 *    supervisor was originally written to catch.
 *
 * Per-tool isolation: a stuck tool doesn't trip the supervisor on
 * unrelated tools. Reset-on-different-fingerprint preserves legitimate
 * adaptive retry behaviour (a tool that fails once with error A, then
 * once with error B, then succeeds, never trips).
 *
 * The supervisor itself never aborts the run; the engine reads the
 * verdict and decides what to surface. On a trip the engine also
 * filters the tripped tool out of the model's toolset for the rest of
 * the run, so the model can't call the broken tool again regardless of
 * how it reads the synth directive.
