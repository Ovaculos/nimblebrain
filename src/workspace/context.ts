/**
 * Single typed access path to workspace-bound resources.
 *
 * Background: NimbleBrain historically threaded `(wsId, workDir)` pairs
 * through every workspace-scoped code path, and dozens of independent
 * call sites constructed `join(workDir, "workspaces", wsId, ...)` for
 * themselves. That made workspace isolation a discipline problem rather
 * than a structural one — a single new caller forgetting to validate or
 * mis-typing the path could escape the workspace tree, and there was no
 * way to grep for "everywhere that touches workspace state."
 *
 * `WorkspaceContext` is the structural fix:
 *
 *   - Constructed once per workspace with `{ wsId, workDir }`. The wsId
 *     is validated against `WORKSPACE_ID_RE` at construction and bound to
 *     the instance as `readonly`. No method on this class takes a `wsId`
 *     argument — the context's wsId is implicit in every operation.
 *
 *   - Owns a `WorkspaceCredentialStore` constructed with the same wsId.
 *     Callers get the bound store via `getCredentialStore()` and never
 *     have a way to construct one for a different workspace through this
 *     context.
 *
 *   - Exposes typed path helpers (`getRoot`, `getDataPath`) so call sites
 *     don't reconstruct the `workspaces/{wsId}/{scope}` layout by hand.
 *
 * The orchestrator (the only entity in the system that legitimately holds
 * more than one `WorkspaceContext`) routes cross-workspace tool calls by
 * looking up the destination workspace's context and dispatching against
 * it. Everything below the orchestrator gets exactly one context and
 * cannot leak across the boundary by construction.

/**
 * Scopes available under a workspace's root. These map 1:1 to the
 * directories created by `scaffoldWorkspace` (see `src/workspace/scaffold.ts`):
 *
 *   - `data`           — bundle data dirs (`{name}/...`)
 *   - `credentials`    — per-bundle credentials, OAuth tokens, secrets
 *   - `conversations`  — JSONL message persistence
 *   - `skills`         — workspace-installed skills
 *   - `files`          — uploaded files / file context
 *
 * `root` returns the workspace root itself (`workspaces/{wsId}/`); it is
 * the parent of every other scope and most callers should prefer a
 * specific scope over `root` so the intent is legible.
