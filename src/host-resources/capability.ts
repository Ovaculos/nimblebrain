/**
 * Host-resources extension capability.
 *
 * Advertised by the platform (acting as MCP Client to each bundle) in the
 * `extensions` block of the `initialize` handshake. `extensions` is MCP's
 * standardized vendor-capability mechanism (see
 * https://modelcontextprotocol.io/extensions/overview); vendors use
 * reverse-DNS keys (`ai.nimblebrain/...` for nimblebrain.ai) to avoid
 * collisions. Bundles read this to decide whether to use the
 * `ai.nimblebrain/resources/{read,list}` extension methods or fall back to
 * inline-content tool arguments.
 *
 * Phase 1 advertises the capability and gates installs on
 * `host_capabilities` entries marked `required: true`. Inbound request
 * handlers ship in Phase 2.
 *
 * Each operation is declared as an object (not a bare boolean) so future
 * sub-fields (`read.range`, `read.unit`, `list.filter`, etc.) slot in without
 * a breaking change. Bundles check `caps.read.enabled` for "can I read?" and
 * `caps.read.range` for the v2 range-read sub-capability.
