/**
 * Coverage for the lifecycle-level OAuth coalesce: `authFlowsInFlight`
 * Map + the terminal-state release in `recordConnectionStateChange`.
 *
 * Pairs with `test/unit/workspace-oauth-provider-concurrency.test.ts`
 * (provider-level coalesce). Two layers, one invariant: at most one
 * OAuth flow per (serverName, wsId, principalId) at a time. The
 * provider tests pin the inner contract (state / verifier / client_id
 * / URL coherence under concurrent SDK auth() calls); this file pins
 * the outer contract (concurrent inbound /v1/mcp-auth/initiate
 * requests coalesce to one flow, and the slot is released exactly on
 * connection-terminal transitions).
 *
 * If any of these break, the production failure mode returns:
 * concurrent inbound requests each start a fresh provider + DCR +
 * source.start, and the lifecycle layer becomes a fresh-flow generator
 * instead of a coalesce point — re-opening the multi-fire race the
 * provider layer is designed to handle but shouldn't HAVE to.
