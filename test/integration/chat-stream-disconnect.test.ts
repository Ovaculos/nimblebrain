/**
 * Regression: a chat run must NOT be cancelled when the HTTP client that
 * started it disconnects mid-stream.
 *
 * The run is owned by the runtime, not by the request transport. A mobile
 * client that locks its screen / backgrounds the tab / hits a network blip
 * tears down the SSE connection, but the engine loop must keep running,
 * persist its result, and stay available to a reconnecting
 * `/v1/conversations/:id/events` subscriber. This is the "leave and come
 * back and it loaded" contract.
 *
 * PR #251 threaded `request.signal` into `runtime.chat`, so a disconnect
 * aborted the run — it died with `run.error: "The connection was closed."`
 * and never produced a reply. This test pins the corrected behavior: after
 * the client disconnects, the conversation still ends in `run.done` with the
 * assistant's response persisted, and no `run.error` is written.
 *
 * On the regressed code this fails (no `run.done`; a connection-closed
 * `run.error` instead).
