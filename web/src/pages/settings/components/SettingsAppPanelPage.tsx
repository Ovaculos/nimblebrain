/**
 * Layout template for *bundle-provided* settings panels — the iframe-hosted
 * UIs registered by bundles via the `settings` placement slot.
 *
 * Without this template, navigating to `/w/<slug>/settings/apps/<server>`
 * dropped the user into a raw, chromeless iframe with no indication that
 * they were still inside settings. This template provides the settings
 * frame consistently — bundle icon and title in the header, back-link to
 * the apps index, and a faint "provided by" footer below the iframe.
 *
 * The iframe is rendered flush — no outer ring or `bg-card`. Bundle UIs
 * already render their own complete content (headings, sections, save
 * bars), so wrapping them in host card chrome produces visible
 * cards-in-cards. This also matches the rule the sibling templates follow
 * (`SettingsFormPage` docstring): pages don't wrap content in cards.
 *
 * The credit is rendered as a footer (not a subtitle) so it recedes
 * properly. Subtitle position competes with the bundle's own internal
 * title for attention; footer position reads as a quiet attribution line.
 *
 * Theme propagation into the iframe is handled separately by `SlotRenderer`
 * (it injects CSS variables and pushes `host-context-changed` events on
 * theme/workspace switch); this template is purely host-side chrome.
