// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Command palette — core types
//
// The palette is a registry of CommandSources. Each source (workspaces, apps,
// actions) implements one `getItems` method over a read-only context and
// returns ordered CommandItems. The container runs the enabled sources, scores
// their items against the query (see match.ts), and renders grouped results
// with a single flat selection index across groups.
//
// Two contexts keep the sources free of React hook wiring (so they're pure and
// unit-testable):
//   - CommandSourceContext: the read-only data a source needs to build items.
//   - CommandRunContext:     the imperative handles an item needs to act on
//                            Enter. Assembled once by the container from the
//                            hooks it consumes.
