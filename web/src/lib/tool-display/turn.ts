/**
 * Turn selector — collapses one assistant turn's `blocks[]` into a single
 * activity timeline for the TurnActivityPill.
 *
 * Two invariants:
 *
 * 1. **Cross-block tool grouping.** Every call of the same (stripped) tool
 *    name within the turn merges into one `tool` entry, regardless of how
 *    reasoning interleaves between calls. The block model only coalesces
 *    *consecutive* tool calls; this selector does the rest. Without it,
 *    extended-thinking turns produce a stack of single-call entries (see
 *    Mercury repro in the redesign notes).
 *
 * 2. **First-occurrence ordering.** A tool group sits at the index of its
 *    first call; later calls of the same tool fold in without moving the
 *    group. Reasoning entries are appended at their own position, so the
 *    timeline still reads "reasoning then activity then more reasoning"
 *    truthfully.
