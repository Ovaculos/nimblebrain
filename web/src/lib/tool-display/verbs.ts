/**
 * Verb inference from tool names.
 *
 * Approach: tokenize the (server-prefix-stripped) tool name on `_`, then
 * pick the FIRST token that matches a known verb root. This handles three
 * shapes uniformly:
 *
 *   "search"              → verb "Searched",   object ""         (bare)
 *   "get_source"          → verb "Read",       object "source"   (verb-first)
 *   "start_research_topic"→ verb "Researched", object "topic"    (prefixed)
 *
 * The `object` is every token after the matched verb, humanized. Tokens
 * before the verb (e.g. "start" in "start_research") are discarded as
 * leading modifiers — they encode "how" the verb runs, not "what".
 *
 * Three tenses per verb:
 *   past tense    "Edited"        — completed (ok tone)
 *   present tense "Editing"       — in flight (running tone)
 *   error form    "Couldn't edit" — failed    (error tone)
 *
 * Past tense is the canonical identifier — it's what inferVerb returns, what
 * dominance compares, and what custom renderers set. Present and error forms
 * are produced by phraseFor based on tone.
 *
 * Batch dominance: when a turn mixes multiple verbs, the batch verb is the
 * one that signals the biggest change. "Edited" wins over "Read"; "Deleted"
 * wins over everything. Reflects how a user would describe what happened —
 * they'd say "I edited the doc" not "I read the doc" even if read came first.
 */

/**
 * Verb roots → past-tense canonical verb.
 *
 * A root matches a single name token (lowercased), not a regex. Add new tools
 * by extending this map plus PRESENT_TENSE and ERROR_VERBS. Keep entries
 * short and unambiguous — a root should be meaningful on its own, not a
 * fragment like "do" or "start" that adds no semantic signal.
